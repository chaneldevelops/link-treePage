# Tech Writing Linktree

I wanted a tech writing portfolio page like linktree but with the ability to group my links in categories so I built one. The page is responsive and light (html/css only)

✨ Feel free to use it as a template! ✨

## Getting started

- fork this repo and clone it
- in the `index.html` file change:
  - the metatags so that they link to your profile picutres, twitter page, etc., (lines 6-25)
  - headers and links (lines 28-52)
  - console message (lines 53-70)
- in the `styles.css` file change colors and play with css if you feel like it
- deploy! I usually deploy such projects on [netlify](netlify.com) or [surge](surge.sh) because they take very little time
